  <!-- **SUBSETS â€”**

1. The page is always launched with one static textarea at the top and an add button that allows the user to add comments.
2. Every comment added will have a reply, a like, and a delete button.
3. A reply button will launch a new text area below the parent comment, allowing the user to either add a reply or cancel the addition.
4. A like button will keep incrementing the number of likes on the respective comment at every click.
5. A delete button will delete the entire comment chain.
6. Comments can be chained resembling a tree-like structure wherein every child comment will be aligned some pixels left
to the parent comment.
7. Comments once added should be persisted on page re-load â€” this is an enhancement, it can be attended to in the end if
you have time.

Before you jump into the code, step back for a few minutes, look at your requirements and assess which parts could use
the same piece of code. -->
